Introduction

The Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System aims to enhance the user's listening experience by suggesting music that aligns with their current emotions. By analyzing user input (e.g., text or voice), the system detects the user's emotional state and then recommends suitable music tracks from Spotify.
Features

    Emotion Detection: Leverages a machine learning model to detect emotions from text inputs.
    Music Recommendation: Recommends music tracks based on the detected emotion using the Spotify API.
    Real-time Processing: Provides quick and relevant music suggestions.
    Easy Integration: Modular and easy to integrate with other applications.

Architecture

    Emotion Detection: Uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify user input into different emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
    Music Recommendation: Based on the detected emotion, the system queries the Spotify API to fetch music tracks that match the user's emotional state.
